There's an amount of functionality that is common to the majority of web applications, this framework aims to provide a reusable platform that provides as much of this functionality as possible "out of the box". These features currently include:

+ Login screen
   + User management and authentication
   + Session management
+ Navigation menu
   + Menu options configuration
   + Hooks system for plugging child DSPs into the menu
